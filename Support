Kinetic Alpha - Executive Support
Welcome to the Kinetic Alpha support terminal.

How the App Works:
Kinetic Alpha is a local neural engine. To execute a command, ensure you have an active Alpha Protocol subscription, type your goal into the deployment bay, and press "Deploy." You can toggle "Sovereign Mode" using the switch in the top right corner.
